### My first time at PAG (Plant and Animal Genome Conference)

Today was the first day of PAGXXIII.

Not much marine here -- only 2 or 3 percent of sequenced genomes are marine (cite)

Wow, AG! Plants! Some very cool work going on in Agriculture 


what I got from today's talks. State of genomics/transcriptomics right now -- not much consensus on tools!!
