Today I went to the RNA Club meeting at the SCRM (Sanford Consortium for Regenerative Medicine) just up the hill from SIO.

Two interesting talks:

Liang Xu, PhD, Postdoc, Dong Wang lab
“Employ “chemical mutation” to dissect key structural features of nucleic acids in governing RNA polymerase II transcriptional fidelity”

RNA pol II transcriptional fidelity .. sugar backbone matters...

and 

Olga Botvinnik, Grad Student, Gene Yeo Lab
“Modeling of alternative splicing at the single cell level and across evolution"

single cell transcriptome analysis —> alt splicing —> heterogeneity of gene expression
