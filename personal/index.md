Sometimes I blog for collaborative projects or about personal experiences.

In 2010, I went on the week-long CalEchoes cruise in the Santa Barbara Basin. Check out our trip blog [here](https://calechoes.wordpress.com).

In 2009, I biked across the country with [Bike and Build](http://bikeandbuild.org). For posts about the importance of affordable housing and my trip from Boston to Santa Barbara, check out [my old wordpress blog](http://tessapie.wordpress.com).
