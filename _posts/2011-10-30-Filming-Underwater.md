title: Filming Underwater
---


I filmed underwater for the first time this weekend while diving at La Jolla Cove. I wasn’t quick enough to get my camera on the huuuuge black seabass that went trucking by us, but I did get a fun seal, some lobstahs (pacific spiny), garibaldi (CA’s state marine fish), kelp bass, a big abalone, and mating crabs! We also saw a couple beautiful Hermissenda nudibranchs, but I couldn’t get good video. Here’s a good shot of one:

Nudibranchs are some of my favorite marine creatures!  Their name comes from Latin (nudus = naked) and Greek (brankhia = gills), meaning naked gills. In Dorid nudibranchs, the gills are tree-like structures on top of their bodies. In this one, as in all Aeolid nudibranchs, there are no gills - oxygen is obtained through simple diffusion into the body. The white-tipped orange structures on its back are known as cerata. When this nudibranch eats hydroids or anenomes, it can extract their stinging cells and store them in its cerata to use in defense against predators. It can also extract and store toxins when it eats sponges. Predators beware!
