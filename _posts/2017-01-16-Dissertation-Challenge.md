Starting up a blog again, both because I've wanted to for a long time and because I need to keep myself sane over the next few months. So here we are.

The next few months are what I'm calling my Dissertation Challenge. I'll be finishing up the variety of projects I've been working on over the past 6+ years, and will be trying to write about them (and other things at SIO).
