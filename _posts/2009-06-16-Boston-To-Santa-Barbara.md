title: Boston To Santa Barbara! 
---

It all starts tomorrow! Sorry I've been lax about posting lately- life got a little busy trying to finish up the school year. So now, I've graduated, have a masters, and am about to embark on a crazy almost 4,000 mile journey across the US. The last century I did was in early May and benefited the American Diabetes Association. it was a blast! I did a bit of riding around monterey, but trained very infrequently in the past month or so due to a busy schedule and a tendonitis issue with my thumbs. Hopefully jumping back into riding with recovering hands wont be too much of an issue as we start our trek. In total, I trained for 860 miles and raised $4681. THANK YOU for making it possible. I would love to send you postcards from along the route, so if I don't have your address, please let me know where I can send a note!

The post below has Mail drops where you can send me letters, if you'd like. I hope you have a wonderful summer, and let me know if there's any place in particular you'd like a postcard from!
