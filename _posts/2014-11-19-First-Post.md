Trying to get back to blogging, this time via github/jekyll!

I'm in the process of passing things over from wordpress and tumblr, so hang tight. 

I'm trying to do more science/professional posts, but check out old posts for adventures in oceanography, science diving, biking across the country and other such life events.
