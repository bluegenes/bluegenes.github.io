title: On PhD and Travel
---


On May 29, 2015, I flew to a different hemisphere, met up with a group of friends I've been close with since college, and hiked the rugged spine of the highest mountain ranges in the world. And it just might have been the best thing I've done since starting my PhD.


Let me backtrack a little. I started my PhD in 2010 with the kind of optimism that should be reserved for 10 year-olds heading off to camp for the first time. I have spent my entire life thinking (knowing) I could make a difference in the world if I just worked hard enough. Don't worry, this ego comes with a heaping serving of self-doubt, just enough to make me a bearable person.
