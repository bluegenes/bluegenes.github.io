title: Jumping Ship: Joining the Cal Echoes Research Cruise
---

terday, someone dropped out of the research cruise I’ve been helping with. So: my choice was 1 week of classes vs. a 9-day research cruise. hmm… Santa Barbara Basin here I come!

View Map

The Cal Echoes Cruise, entirely student led, will spend a week characterizing the ecosystems in the SB basin Why there, you ask? The Santa Barbara Basin is an interesting place for several reasons. First, the bottom is mostly anoxic (no oxygen), so not many animals can live in the sediments. With few animals burrowing and mixing up the sediments, they stack up over time in neat layers, much like growth rings on a tree. By taking a core of the bottom, we get a sample of the layers and can figure out what the ecosystem was like in the past - if it was anoxic, what animals were common in the waters above it, and even if any abrupt climate changes happened.

Second, the SB basin is the site of extensive monitoring by CALCOFI cruises over the past 60 years. We can add to their record, and we can use their data to determine what changes are currently taking place.

For further info on the SB Basin, see: http://calechoes.ucsd.edu/sb_basin.html

The cruise will be on the R/V Melville, the largest ship in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography fleet.

There will be 23 crew members and 38 scientific team members. Of the 38 science members, a number are actually not grad students or professors, but rather are educators who are using the cruise to create marine science curriculum for high school and middle school students in San Diego and around the country. Each day, these educators will create a video from the cruise, giving their students an idea of life on a research vessel and how to conduct oceanography research. They will also create a “virtual collection” that will contain images of the animals collected on the trip and allow students to embark on a virtual research cruise from the classroom.

I’m honored and excited to be helping out with the cruise - If we have good internet (Hi Seas Net) I’ll be blogging and posting pics- this will be my first time at sea for more than a single day!
