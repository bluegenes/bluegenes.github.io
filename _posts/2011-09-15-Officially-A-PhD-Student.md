title: 30 Rock: graduate students are the worst
---

[link video] 

I'm officially a PhD student! hear me roar? 

Ok, so technically I've been here taking a climate change course since June, but the rest of the students in my year arrive in a couple weeks and we'll start our 5+ years together.

I'm a complete marine biology nerd who loves to scuba dive and adventure my way through life. I'll post about the oceans, grad life, and San Diego.
