title: On Arrogance, from a Recovering Millenial

I thought that I was free from the arrogance than characterized the spoiled kids at my uniformed private school, the guy driving daddy’s newest four-wheeled purchase, despite having recently crashed the last one ...

I thought I was outside of it, above it. But therein lies the problem. My arrogance was simply directed differently. In a sense, the crippling anxiety I often feel is, deep down, rooted in arrogance. I feel I should have done great things by now. That I’m wasting the incredible potential I was always told I had.

I have always wanted to change the world. To better it. But worse, I have always believed not that I could - but that I *should*.


Maybe this stems from basing my identity on the only thing I thought I had going for me — my grades. As the chubby kid, I wasn’t liked for my looks. As the introverted kid, my witty observations of the world around me stayed firmly in my head, only shared with a tight-knit group of friends who had accepted that we were on the nerdier side of the spectrum.

But I digress. I just wanted to merely point out the arrogance that is likely at the root of my issues moving forward with my work. I need to remember that doing science is a privilege. That getting to put my mind to the problems of the world is a gift the world is giving to me, and I shouldn’t waste it. 


I need to remember that nothing needs to be perfect, because anything that gets done and shared with the world is automatically better than something theoretically perfect, shared only within the confines of my own white and gray matter.
