I'm also interested working to help overcome the issues and disadvantages that women and students from diverse backgrounds (both racial and economical) face in pursuing           science. At SIO, I work as part of TIDES, the Team for Improving Diversity and Engagement in Science (formerly GDAWG), where we focus on raising awareness of these issues         around SIO and UCSD, and on trying to bring science out to a broader community.
