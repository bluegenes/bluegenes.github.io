I'm a PhD Candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD, advised by [Ron Burton](http://burtonlab.weebly.com/store/c1/Featured_Products.html/) and [Terry Gaasterland](http://genomes.ucsd.edu/). 

I conduct interdisciplinary research focusing on the response of the California market squid, *Doryteuthis opalescens*, to low oxygen and low pH conditions. I focus on response at the gene expression level, using transcriptome analyses. My broad goal is to explore interesting biological questions, particularly in ecology, evolution, and environmental change, via bioinformatic techniques. For the most part, my work focuses on genomics and transcriptomics of non-model marine species. For more, go [here](http://bluegenes.github.io/research/). I'm particularly interested in bringing more diverse perspectives into marine science and omics work, and work with the TIDES (Team for Inclusion of Diversity in Education and Science) group here at SIO. 

I'm probably a bit too obsessed with coffee, books, and hiking across hillsides with my incredible dog, [Loba](http://bluegenes.github.io/loba/).
