I'm a PhD Candidate at Scripps Institution of Oceanography, UCSD, advised by Ron Burton and Terry Gaasterland. 

I conduct interdisciplinary research focusing on the response of the California market squid, *Doryteuthis opalescens*, to low oxygen and low pH conditions. I focus on response at the gene expression level, using transcriptome analyses. 


My broad goal is to explore interesting biological questions, particularly in ecology, evolution, and environmental change, via bioinformatic techniques. For the most part, my work focuses on genomics and transcriptomics of non-model marine species.
